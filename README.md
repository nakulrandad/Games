# Games for you to play... 🎮🎲

Here are some games developed by me because why not 😄.
Enjoy them (and give valuable feedback)!

### Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the codes
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
