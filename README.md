# Games for you to play... ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ²

Here are some games developed by me (because developing games is always fun ðŸ˜„).
Enjoy them and give valuable feedback!

### Installation
The `requirements.txt` file lists all Python libraries that the codes
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
